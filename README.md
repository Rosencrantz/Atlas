Atlas

Atlas is a user interface prototyping tool. It purpose is to provides a number of simple, easy to use patterns for creating common user interface features, without the contraints of existing design or style.

In an effort to provide simple patterns Atlas provides a set of small components that can be composed into larger, more complex features. The most simple components provided by Atlas consist of a trigger and a container, the dropdown serves as a good example:

<a data-trigger="dropdown" aria-owns="container">Trigger</a>
<div id="container">Container</a>
