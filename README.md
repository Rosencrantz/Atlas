Atlas

Atlas is a user interface prototyping tool. It purpose is to provides a number of simple, easy to use patterns for creating common user interface features.

In an effort to provide the most simple patterns Atlas provides a set of small components that can be composed into larger, more complex features. The most simple components provided by Atlas consist of a trigger and a container, the dropdown serves as a good example:

&lt;a data-trigger="dropdown" aria-owns="container"&gt;Trigger&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id="container"&gt;Container&lt;/a&gt;
