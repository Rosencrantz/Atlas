ATLAS

Atlas is a user interface prototyping tool. It is designed to be easy to use for those of us not blessed with a full understanding of Javascript. At the core of ATLAS are a number of simple patterns that the developer can use to build interfaces.

Atlas patterns work from the principle that most interations on a web page invole a trigger and a container. When you interact with the trigger something happens to the container. Dropdowns, Dialogs, Tabs and Popovers are all examples of this trigger/container interaction.
