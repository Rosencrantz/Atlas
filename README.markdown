#Atlas

Atlas is a user interface prototyping tool. It purpose is to provides a number of simple, easy to use patterns for creating common user interface features, without the contraints of existing design or style.

In an effort to provide simple patterns Atlas provides a set of small components that can be composed into larger, more complex features. The most simple components provided by Atlas consist of a trigger and a container, the markup for which is terse and easy to commit to memory. More can be found in the documentation on this subject

## Getting started

The best this to do if you want to understand Atlas is to fork the respository and start hacking around with it. If you are interested in running the system locally fork it and then open a terminal window in the root of the project. From there type: 

> make run

This will start a simple http server that you can then use to develop, browse documentation, run tests and have fun!
